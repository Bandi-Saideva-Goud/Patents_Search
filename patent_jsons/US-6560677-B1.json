The designation of the respective subsets is provided by a normal subset floor index, a transient subset floor index, and a transient subset ceiling index. The respective indexes are used to select the subset into which new entries are copied from main memory as a result of a cache miss. If the new entry is designated as being characterized by normal program behavior, it is copied into the normal subset in the cache. If the new entry is designated as being characterized by transient program behavior, it is copied into the transient subset in the cache. The relationship between the normal subset and the transient subset is programmable. For example, the normal and the transient subsets may include at least one common way of the cache memory or the transient subset may be completely included in the normal subset or completely separate therefrom.</p></abstract>"}], "claims": [{"lang": "EN", "claims": [{"num": 1, "parent": -1, "type": "independent", "paragraph_markup": "<claim id=\"US-6560677-B1-CLM-00001\" num=\"1\"><claim-text>1.

With respect to the main memory, the cache memory is typically a high speed, low capacity memory in which active portions of program instructions and/or data are stored. The cache memory is typically faster than a main memory by a factor of 5 to 10 and typically approaches the speed of the CPU itself. By keeping some of the most frequently accessed instructions and/or data in the cache memory, the average memory access time may approach the access time of the cache memory and thereby improve the overall performance of the computing system.</p><p>In particular, improved performance of the computing system may be achieved by presuming that the computer program exhibits a behavior known as \u201clocality of reference.\u201d The locality of reference phenomenon recognizes that most computer program instruction processing proceeds in loops and subroutines which tends to limit memory references made by the computer program to a localized area of memory. Similarly, memory references to data may tend to be localized, because table lookup routines or other iterative routines may repeatedly refer to memory addresses within a relatively small range of memory addresses. Accordingly, although the cache memory may have small capacity, a large fraction of the data or instructions requested may be located in the cache memory and thereby improve the performance of the computing system. Data and/or instructions which exhibit locality of reference behavior are sometimes referred to as normal entries.</p><p>In operation, the CPU requests data or instructions for processing. If the requested data or instructions are stored in the cache memory (a cache hit), the requested data or instructions are provided to the CPU according to the speed of the cache memory. If, however, the requested data or instruction is not stored in the cache memory (a cache miss), a block of words (including the requested data or instruction) is accessed in the main memory and provided to the CPU according to the speed of the main memory. In addition, the block of words accessed in the main memory is copied into the cache memory so that future requests to the same words will be serviced by the cache memory. Accordingly, existing entries within the cache may be replaced by the block of words retrieved from the main memory. For example, when a cache miss results in a block of words being retrieved from main memory, a correspondingly sized portion of the cache may be replaced (overwritten) by the block of words retrieved from the main memory. The cache entries selected for replacement are sometimes referred to as \u201cvictims.\u201d</p><p>It is known to use replacement schemes, such as a Least Recently Used (LRU) or a round-robin scheme, to select the victims in the cache when a block is copied from main memory into the cache. For example, it is known to use an LRU scheme when replacing normal entries in the cache with data and/or instructions from main memory that exhibit the same locality of reference behavior (i. e., normal). Such cache systems are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,809,527 entitled \u201cOutboard File Cache System\u201d to Cooper et al. which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>On the other hand, some data and/or instructions such as global variables or address pointers, are used by the CPU on an ongoing basis. Such data and/or instructions may be requested by the CPU despite the operational behavior exhibited by the computer program. For example, a program that otherwise exhibits locality of reference behavior may use an address pointer to a particular interrupt routine irrespective of the instructions the computer program is executing when an interrupt is received. Accordingly, some data and/or instructions stored in the cache can be locked so that they cannot be replaced, thereby improving the likelihood that the requested data and/or instructions are stored in the cache.</p><p>Although some types of data and instructions stored in the cache exhibit locality of reference behavior (e.g., normal entries) other types of entries may not. For example, the CPU may move video data from the main memory to a video frame buffer only once and subsequently may not request the same data again once the move is complete. Such data and/or instructions in the cache are referred to as \u201ctransient.\u201d In such situations, the locality of reference presumption, may degrade the performance of the cache memory by replacing normal entries (which may be subsequently requested) with transient entries. Consequently, subsequent requests for the normal entries which were replaced with the transient entries may result in cache misses, thereby reducing the performance of the cache. Accordingly, it is known to use separate cache memories to store transient and normal data and/or instructions. In view of the above, there exists a need to improve cache memories wherein different types of data and/or instructions (such as locked, normal, and transient) are processed in cache memory systems.</p><h4>SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION</h4><p>In view of the above, it is an object of the present invention to allow improvement in the performance of cache memories.</p><p>It is another object of the present invention to allow more efficient use of cache memories.</p><p>These and other objects of the present invention may be provided by designating normal, transient, and locked subsets of the ways of a cache memory. On a cache miss, entries from the main memory are copied into the normal or the transient subset of the ways of the cache memory. The subset to which the entry is copied is selected based on the program behavior associated with the entry copied from main memory. For example, if an entry in main memory has an attribute associated with it that indicates that the entry exhibits normal program behavior, the normal subset is selected. If the entry in main memory has an attribute associated with it that indicates that the entry exhibits transient program behavior, the transient subset is selected. In one embodiment, the attribute associated with the entry is held in a memory management page table. In an alternate embodiment, a particular instruction (such as a load transient or load normal instruction) in the instruction set of the CPU is used.</p><p>Designating the normal subset for normal entries and the transient subset for transient entries may allow both types of entries to be processed while reducing the likelihood that interaction between the normal and transient entries may adversely affect the performance of the cache. For example, if transient entries are allowed to overwrite normal entries the cache performance with respect to the normal entries may be reduced.</p><p>In a further aspect of the present invention, the designations of the normal, transient, and locked subsets are programmable. The designated subsets may, therefore, be altered to meet to changing processing requirements. For example, the designations of the subsets may be changed to designate a greater portion of the cache for normal entries.</p><p>In another aspect of the present invention, at least one way included in the transient subset is included in the normal subset. Accordingly, entries designated as normal or transient may be copied into the common ways of the subsets.</p><?BRFSUM description=\"Brief Summary\" end=\"tail\"?><?brief-description-of-drawings description=\"Brief Description of Drawings\" end=\"lead\"?><h4>BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGURES</h4><p>FIG. 1A is a block diagram of an embodiment of a computer system according to the present invention;</p><p>FIG. 1B is a block diagram of an exemplary associative cache memory;</p><p>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of a cache memory system having normal, transient, and locked subsets designated therein according to the present invention;</p><p>FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a second embodiment of a cache memory system having normal, transient, and locked subsets designated therein according to the present invention;</p><p>FIG. 4 is a block diagram of a third embodiment of a cache memory system according to the present invention; and</p><p>FIG. 5 is a flowchart that illustrates operations of a cache memory system according to the present invention.</p><?brief-description-of-drawings description=\"Brief Description of Drawings\" end=\"tail\"?><?DETDESC description=\"Detailed Description\" end=\"lead\"?><h4>DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION</h4><p>The present invention now will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which preferred embodiments of the invention are shown.

A Central Processing Unit (CPU) <b>105</b> processes entries stored in a cache memory system <b>100</b> and a main memory <b>115</b> to carry out task assigned to the CPU by system software such as an operating system. It will be understood to those having skill in that art that the CPU <b>105</b> can be a single microprocessor or plurality of microprocessors in a multiprocessing computing system, wherein the microprocessor include a cache memory according to the present invention. Alternately, a cache memory according to the present invention may be located external to the microprocessor. For example, the present invention may be embodied in a secondary level cache on a computer motherboard. The main memory <b>115</b> may comprise Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) or other types of storage devices suitable for use as a main memory with cache memories.</p><p>The cache memory system <b>100</b> includes a cache memory <b>110</b> that stores data as cache entries and a memory interface <b>120</b> that accesses data stored in the main memory <b>115</b>. The entries in the cache memory <b>110</b> include a tag field and a data field. The CPU <b>105</b> requests an entry by providing an address to the cache memory <b>110</b>. In one embodiment, the address provided by the CPU <b>105</b> is used to index into the cache memory <b>110</b> to access a tag field of the cache memory <b>110</b>. If the cache memory <b>110</b> includes a tag field that matches the address provided by the CPU <b>105</b> (a cache hit), the data field associated with the matching tag field is provided to the CPU <b>105</b>. If, however, the address provided by the CPU <b>105</b> does not match any of the tag fields stored in the cache memory <b>110</b> (a cache miss), the memory interface <b>120</b> uses the address provided by the CPU <b>105</b> to accesses the requested entry in the main memory <b>115</b> and provides the data to the CPU <b>105</b>. In particular, the memory interface <b>120</b> accesses a cache line of data that includes the requested entry and the line is copied into the cache memory <b>110</b>. In a preferred embodiment; a cache line comprises a unit of data which is replaced in the cache memory <b>110</b> on a cache miss and may include more or less or the same amount of data requested by the CPU <b>105</b>.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cache memory <b>110</b> is a multi-way set associative cache memory. As will be understood by those having skill in the art, a \u201cway\u201d is one entry in each of the sets of the cache memory. A \u201cset\u201d is equal to one entry from each of the ways accessed. A portion of a way from a set of the cache memory comprises a cache line. For example, FIG. 1B is a simplified block diagram of an exemplary 32 KiloByte (KB) set associative cache organized as 4 sets with 32 byte lines. As shown in FIG. 1B, the organization of the ways and sets is represented as a matrix <b>147</b>, wherein each row represents one of the four sets and the intersection of each row and column represents a cache line of 32 bytes. A way, therefore, comprises the four cache lines represented by the intersection of one column with each of the four rows (sets). Multi-way set associative caches are discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,367,653 to Coyle et al. entitled \u201cReconfigurable Multi-Way Associative Cache Memories\u201d and assigned to the present assignee which is incorporated herein by reference.</p><p>FIG. 2 is a block diagram of a first embodiment of an associative cache memory <b>200</b> and subset indexes <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> according to the present invention. According to FIG. 2, the associative cache memory <b>200</b> is a 256-way set associative cache memory organized as 4 sets wherein each set includes 256 lines. A way comprises one entry from each of the 4 sets. Each of the 256 ways can be designated as being included in one of three subsets of the 256 ways: normal, transient, or locked. The designation of each way is based on three subset indexes: a normal subset floor index <b>205</b>, a transient subset ceiling index <b>210</b>, and a transient subset floor index <b>215</b>. As shown in FIG. 2, the normal subset of the 256 ways starts at the way which corresponds to the normal subset floor index <b>205</b> and ends at the last way in the cache memory. The transient subset of the 256 ways starts at the way which corresponds to the transient subset floor <b>215</b> index and ends at the way which corresponds to the transient subset ceiling index <b>210</b>. All of the ways not included in either the normal or transient subsets are in the locked subset. In a preferred embodiment, each of the sets in the associative cache memory <b>200</b> is implemented using a Content Addressable Memory (CAM) wherein each set is embodied as a 256 entry fully set associative cache memory.</p><p>The subset index values can be the same for each of the 4 sets in the associative cache memory <b>200</b> or can be different for each of the sets. Accordingly, in a further embodiment, separate subset indexes are maintained for each of the sets so that separate normal, transient, and locked subsets can be designated for each set.</p><p>The subset indexes can be stored in a register so that the subset index values can be referenced and updated during operation of the associative cache memory <b>200</b>. In particular, storing the subset indexes in a register enables system software to update the designation of the subsets dynamically. When the data processed by the CPU <b>105</b> changes, the system software can change the designations of the subsets to preserve the performance of the associative cache memory despite the change in the program behavior exhibited by the data. The designated subsets may, therefore, be altered to meet to changing processing requirements. For example, the designations of the subsets may be changed to designate a greater portion of the cache for normal entries.</p><p>On a cache miss a cache line including, the requested entry is copied from the main memory <b>115</b> to a selected subset of the ways of the associative cache memory <b>200</b>. The subset is selected based on an indication of the program behavior associated with the address of the cache line copied from the main memory <b>115</b>. For example, if the process is designated as exhibiting normal program behavior, the cache line is copied into the normal subset. If the access is designated as exhibiting transient program behavior, it is copied into the transient subset. The program behavior of the cache line can be determined via an indication associated with the address in main memory <b>115</b> from which the cache line was accessed or using a storage instruction which has an associated program behavior (such as a first instruction used to copy transient data from main memory <b>115</b> and a second instruction used to copy normal data from the main memory <b>115</b> to the associative cache memory <b>200</b>).</p><p>The line is copied from the main memory <b>115</b> into the selected subset and overwrites an existing entry in the associative cache memory <b>200</b>. Accordingly, an existing entry in the associative cache memory <b>200</b> is selected for replacement (the victim) in the selected subset of the associative cache memory <b>200</b>. The scheme for victim selection can comprise a least recently used scheme, a round-robin scheme, or another victim replacement scheme known to those having skill in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the victim selection scheme is tailored to the subset for which victim indexes are generated. For example, the normal subset may use a least recently used scheme because of the locality of reference behavior exhibited by the normal data. The transient subset may use an incremental round-robin scheme due to the fact that transient data is accessed once and in a linear fashion, such as when processing video data. In another embodiment, the victim selection scheme is the same for the normal and transient subsets.</p><p>FIG. 3 is block diagram of a second embodiment of the associative cache memory <b>200</b> and subset index <b>205</b>, <b>210</b>, <b>215</b> shown in FIG. <b>2</b>. According to FIG. 3, the subset indexes designate that the transient subset is included in (or overlaps) the normal subset. For example, entries that exhibit transient program behavior are stored at indexes <b>8</b> to <b>16</b> in the associative cache memory <b>200</b>. Entries that exhibit normal program behavior are be stored at indexes <b>8</b> to <b>255</b>. Consequently, transient entries can overwrite normal entries stored at indexes <b>8</b> to <b>16</b>. Similarly, transient entries in the associative cache memory <b>200</b> can be overwritten with normal entries.</p><p>Including the transient subset in the normal subset may provide improved performance of the associative cache memory <b>200</b> by allowing more entries of the associative cache memory <b>200</b> to be used for normal data while still allowing the storage of transient data. For example, if a computing system according to the present invention processes mostly normal data, designating as many of the cache entries in the normal subset may improve performance. If, however, the computing system occasionally processes transient data as well, overlapping the normal and transient subsets may allow the transient data to be stored in the cache without significantly reducing the performance of the associative cache memory <b>200</b> with respect to processing of the normal data.</p><p>In a preferred embodiment, the subsets of the ways of the cache memory can be initialized by designating what will be in the locked subset during operation as normal until the desired entries are stored in the cache, and then changing the designation of the ways as being outside the normal or transient subset (i. e., in the locked subset). For example, if ways <b>0</b> through <b>7</b> are to designated as being in the locked subset during normal operation, the system can initially store the locked entries by designating ways <b>0</b> though <b>7</b> as being in the normal subset (such as by setting the normal subset floor index to 0). Accordingly, entries can then be copied to ways <b>0</b> through <b>7</b>. Then, the normal subset floor index is changed to exclude ways <b>0</b> through <b>7</b> (such as by setting the normal subset floor index to 8).</p><p>In an alternate embodiment, privileged storage instructions, such as \u201cload and lock\u201d, are used to copy entries to the ways of the cache that are otherwise in the locked subset. Alternately, a storage attribute can be associated with the entries which are to be copied into the locked subset.</p><p>A series of examples will now be described with reference to FIG. <b>4</b>. According to FIG. 4, system software directs the CPU <b>105</b> to begin executing a word processing program, wherein a relatively large portion of the data processed by the CPU <b>105</b> exhibits normal program behavior. The normal, transient, and locked subsets are designated to provide adequately sized subsets for the operation of the cache memory. For example, initially the normal subset floor index may be set to designate a relatively large subset of the ways of the cache memory as normal. The transient subset floor index and the transient subset ceiling index are set to provide a relatively small subset of the of the ways of the cache memory as transient.</p><p>A first address A<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>is provided by the CPU <b>105</b> to the cache memory. Each of the subsets of the ways of the cache memory is checked for a tag which is equal to A<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>and a cache miss is indicated. The first address A<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>is used to access the main memory <b>115</b> whereupon a cache line equal to F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b><sub>16 </sub>is provided to the program behavior logic <b>400</b>. The program behavior logic <b>400</b> determines that the cache line accessed from the first address A<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>of the main memory <b>115</b> has an associated normal program behavior attribute. The cache line F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b>F<b>0</b><sub>16 </sub>is copied into the normal subset of the cache memory at an index generated by normal victim selection logic <b>405</b>.</p><p>Next, the system software directs the CPU <b>105</b> to begin executing an video processing program wherein a relatively large amount of the data processed exhibits transient program behavior. Consequently, the normal, transient, and locked subsets are re-designated to provide adequately sized subsets for the operation of the cache memory. For example, the normal subset floor index may be changed to designate a relatively small subset of the ways of the cache memory as normal. The transient subset floor index and the transient subset ceiling index are changed to provide a relatively large subset of the of the ways of the cache memory as transient. The increase in the size of the transient subset is intended to provide better cache memory performance in view of the different program behavior that may be exhibited by the video processing program.</p><p>A second address B<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>is provided by the CPU <b>105</b> to the cache memory. Each of the subsets of the ways of the cache memory is checked for a tag which is a equal to B<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>and a cache miss is indicated. The second address B<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>is used to access the main memory <b>115</b> whereupon a cache line C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b><sub>6 </sub>is provided to the program behavior logic <b>400</b>. The program behavior logic <b>400</b> determines that the cache line acceded from the second address B<b>000</b><sub>16 </sub>of the main memory <b>115</b> has an associated transient program behavior attribute. Accordingly, the cache line C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b>C<b>0</b><sub>16 </sub>is copied into the transient subset of the cache memory at an index generated by transient victim selection logic <b>410</b>.</p><p>FIG. 5 is a flowchart that illustrates operations of a cache memory <b>110</b> according to the present invention. According to FIG. 5, processing begins at block <b>500</b>. The normal, transient, and locked subsets of the ways of the cache memory are designated using the normal subset floor index, the transient subset ceiling index, and the transient subset floor index (block <b>505</b>).</p><p>When a request for an entry is received from the CPU, the cache determines if the requested entry is stored in any of the normal, transient, or locked subsets (block <b>510</b>). If the requested entry is stored in the cache (a cache hit), the requested entry is provided to the CPU (block <b>520</b>) whereupon processing continues when a new request is received from the CPU (block <b>508</b>).</p><p>If the requested entry is not stored in the CPU (block <b>510</b>), a cache miss occurs and the requested entry is accessed in the main memory and provided to the CPU (block <b>515</b>). If the requested entry exhibits normal program behavior (block <b>525</b>), the normal victim selection logic generates a victim index (block <b>530</b>) whereupon the entry accessed from main memory is stored at the generated victim index in the normal subset of the ways of the cache memory (block <b>535</b>).
